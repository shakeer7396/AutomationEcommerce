----> .Xml file in Testing
.. TestNG.xml file is a setup/configuration file that helps us in organizing our test cases in the right pattern
.. It also help us in making Test Suites and Test methods. By using the XML file approach, it makes it to easy to understand the code

----> Parallel Testing
.. The main purpose of running tests in parallel mode is to reduce execution time and do maximum environment coverage (browsers/devices/environment) in less time.
.. TestNG helps to run test methods/classes/tests in parallel. Using the testing.xml file, one can specify parallel attributes to classes, tests, and methods.


----> Add Listeners and Generate reports using Screenshots of testcase. Generate Reports seperately.
